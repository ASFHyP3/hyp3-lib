# HyP3-lib

## Common library for HyP3 plugins

### Please note that the use of `hyp3lib` version 2 or less is **_NOT_** recommended. 

This library is outdated and largely untested, containing a broad collection of scripts/tools developed for upstream packages that have since undergone many *major* releases. 

HyP3 plugins only use a subset of this repository, and version 3 will include drastic changes to reduce the library's scope to *just* those codes supporting HyP3 plugin development. We suggest *not* using this library, *especially* in a production environment, until version 3.0. 

If you're a MintPy user looking to crop HyP3 products, please see our [Time Series Analysis with HyP3 and Mintpy Tutorial](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/tutorials/mintpy).

For other uses, we suggest checking out our [`asf-tools`](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/asf-tools) Python library and/or the [HyP3 Python SDK](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk).
